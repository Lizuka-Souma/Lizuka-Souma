I know this sounds stupid, but if you play ponytown then intwec. I play ponytown, but I mind my buisness. Most ponytown players are the most toxic and annoying people you'll ever meet fr. If it ain't somebody harrassing or being judgemental of others bc of their style, unproblematic cosplay or just bullying kids in general, thens its mfs lowk being mad disgusting and doing and saying 18+ things on the SAFE SEVER...Literally stop riding peoples dick and get a fucking life instead of being an asshole and a pervert fr LMAOOOOOO

I'm always just walking around on Ponytown or sitting in an empty space and offtab.
